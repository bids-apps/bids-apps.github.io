Welcome to the BIDS Apps repository! :rocket:

We're excited that you're here and equally thrilled to know that you want to
contribute. :superhero:

BIDS-Apps are a collection of containerized neuroimaging workflows and pipelines
that accept datasets organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure
(BIDS). To learn more please visit our
[Homepage](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io)

These guidelines are designed especially to make the whole process as easy and
smooth as possible. Still, if something is unclear or not mentioned please don't
hesitate to ask. [Email us](ffein@stanford.edu) or let us know by opening an
[issue!](https://github.com/bids-apps/bids-apps.github.io/issues)

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/)
account and sign in. Here are some
[instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github).

categorizing them based on their characteristics. Please take a look at the
different types of labels we use.

## Making a change with a pull request :zap:

Pull requests with patches, improvements and new features are a great help.

### Fork the project, clone your fork, and add the BIDS Apps remote:

```sh
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/bids-apps.github.io.git

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd bids-apps.github.io

# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream git@github.com:bids-apps/bids-apps.github.io.git
```

### Get the latest changes from upstream:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

### Create a new branch from the main master branch to contain your changes:

```sh
git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
```

### Add and Commit your changes

```sh
git add <path/to/modified/file/>
git commit -m "write a commit message"
```

Examine the status of your working tree at each step to see if everything is
clean:

```sh
git status
```

Push your topic branch up to your fork:

```sh
git push origin <topic-branch-name>
```

## Build the website locally

Requires to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/#prerequisites) (a static
website generator).

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description against the master branch.

[Open a Pull Request.](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Example Pull Request

![Example Pull Request](https://i.imgur.com/s8yELfK.png)

A maintainer/developer will review and might suggest some changes before merging
them into the repository.

Success!! :tada: Well done! :bowing_man:

Note that each Pull Request will be accompanied by a preview of the website built by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
Just see the status checks at the bottom of your Pull Request in the browser.
